How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs, it makes everything easier when everything is clear and concise. Which may mean giving variables proper names or adding comments to follow standard practice. This will allow anyone reading the code to follow your thought process without any issues. Not only is this the best way to write code for the CRUD Python module, but it makes it easier to use on future project if needed. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To understand the problem, you will first have to understand the problem and break it down into manageble sections. create the code, test it and add comments for easier understanding. For the Salvare project, I tried to first understand what the proble is and what it is asking of me to do. For future projects, I can follow this database code and make changes depending on what the next requirements are.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are instrumental in shaping the future through innovation. They develop coding software, analyze data, and safeguard systems with cybersecurity measures. Their work is essential for driving technological advancement and addressing complex challenges, ensuring a brighter and more secure future.
